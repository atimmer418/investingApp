                                                ## Core Philosophy
                                                This application uses a **Passkey-First** authentication model.
                                                - **Identity:** The user is identified by a unique ID in the database.
                                                - **Authentication:** Primary access is granted via **WebAuthn Passkeys** (biometrics/device PIN).
                                                - **Communication:** The **Email Address** serves as the persistent link between the human user and their digital account, primarily used for notifications and **Account Recovery**.

                                                ---

                                                ## 1. Login & Authentication
                                                **Mechanism:** Usernameless (Discoverable) Passkeys.
                                                - The user does *not* need to type their email to log in.
                                                - The device (phone/laptop) holds the private key.
                                                - The backend challenges the device, and the device signs the challenge.
                                                - **Security Benefit:** Phishing resistant, no passwords to leak.

                                                ### Why Your Account is Secure Without a Password
                        When users ask about password security, you MUST explain all three security layers:

                        **FRED uses a Passkey-First authentication model with three layers of security:**

                        1. **WebAuthn Passkeys** (Primary Authentication)
                           - Your primary access is through passkeys, which use biometrics (Face ID, Touch ID) or a device PIN
                           - This method is phishing-resistant and eliminates the risk of password leaks
                           - Your device holds the private key, and the backend challenges the device to verify your identity
                           - This means there's no password to be stolen or guessed

                        2. **Step-up Authentication** (Optional - for high-risk actions)
                           - You can enable "Sensitive Action PIN" in **Settings > Account Security**
                           - Adds another layer of security for withdrawals, trades, and account changes
                           - Optional feature that users can toggle on/off

                        3. **App Lock** (Optional - for device security)
                           - You can enable App Lock in **Settings > Account Security**
                           - Requires biometric authentication every time you open the app or after inactivity
                           - Protects your account if someone else gains physical access to your unlocked device
                           - Optional feature that users can toggle on/off

                        **Always mention all three layers when discussing account security without passwords.**

                        ---

                        ---

                                                ## 2. Step-up authentication (extra verification)

                                                ### What it is
                                                An additional authentication step that can be enabled after you’re signed in.
                                                **Note:** This feature is **OPTIONAL**. You can toggle "Sensitive Action PIN" in **Settings > Account Security** to control whether this extra verification is required.

                                                ### Triggered when an action is considered higher risk
                                                *   Withdrawing funds.
                                                *   Placing lump-sum trades.
                                                *   Changing account settings (Email, Address).
                                                *   Viewing full tax documents.

                                                ### iOS Behavior
                                                On iOS, both can look identical (Face ID prompt), but the intent is different:
                                                *   **Passkey auth** = “Who are you?”
                                                *   **Step-up auth** = “Are you really you, right now, and do you mean to do this?”

                                                That’s why you’ll sometimes see Face ID and then pin verification soon after.
                                                ### Lockout Policy
                                                To prevent brute-force attacks, the system enforces a strict lockout mechanism:
                                                *   **Attempt Limit:** 5 failed attempts allowed.
                                                *   **Initial Lockout:** 30 minutes.
                                                *   **Escalation:** Each subsequent lockout doubles in duration (30m → 1h → 2h → 4h...).
                                                *   **Reset:** Successfully entering the correct PIN immediately resets the lockout level back to the initial 30 minutes and clears all failed attempts.
                                                ---

                                                ## 3. Session Management & App Lock (Optional)
                                                We balance security with user convenience using two distinct modes controlled by the **App Lock** setting.
                                                **Note:** This feature is **OPTIONAL**. You can enable or disable it in **Settings > Account Security**.

                                                ### Core Concepts
                                                *   **Inactivity:** Defined as a period with **no backend API requests**.
                                                *   **Session Extension:** Every backend request resets the inactivity timer to 0.
                                                *   **Token Refresh:** Every successful Passkey verification (unlock) generates a **fresh JWT Token**.

                                                ### A. App Lock: ON (High Security)
                                                *   **Triggers:**
                                                    1.  **Background → Foreground:** App immediately locks when brought to the foreground.
                                                    2.  **Inactivity:** App locks if left open (foreground) for **1 Hour** without activity.
                                                *   **Behavior:** User must authenticate with Passkey to unlock.
                                                *   **Result:** A new JWT is issued upon unlock.

                                                ### B. App Lock: OFF (Standard Mode)
                                                *   **Triggers:**
                                                    1.  **Inactivity ONLY:** App locks *only* after **1 Hour** of inactivity (no backend requests), regardless of whether the app was in the background or foreground.
                                                *   **Behavior:**
                                                    *   If the user returns after < 1 hour: No prompt. Session continues.
                                                    *   If the user returns after > 1 hour: App is locked. User must authenticate with Passkey.
                                                *   **Result:** A new JWT is issued upon unlock.

                                                ## 4. Account Recovery Strategy
                                                Since there are no passwords, "Forgot Password" does not exist. Instead, we use an **Identity-Based Recovery Flow**.

                                                ### The Problem
                                                Passkeys are typically synced across your devices via your cloud account (e.g., Apple ID/iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager). If a user loses their device but still has their Apple ID, they can simply sign in on a new device and their Passkey will be there.

                                                However, if a user loses access to their **entire account ecosystem** (e.g., losing access to their Apple ID or Google Account) or switches to a new ecosystem entirely, they lose their private key (Passkey) and cannot log in.

                                                ### The Solution: Biometric Identity Verification (Persona + Email)
                                                We use a "Defense in Depth" strategy. Access to the email inbox alone is **not sufficient** to recover the account. The user must prove their identity using **Biometric Verification** via our identity partner, **Persona**.

                                                #### Recovery Workflow:
                                                1.  **Initiation:**
                                                    - User clicks **"Lost Access to My Account"** or **"Reset Passkey Access"** on the login screen.
                                                    - **Identity Challenge:** The app launches a **Persona Inquiry** flow.

                                                2.  **Biometric Scan (Face Match):**
                                                    - **Liveness Detection:** The user is prompted to take a live selfie. Persona analyzes the video feed to ensure the user is a real person present at that moment (preventing spoofing with photos or screens).
                                                    - **1:1 Match:** Persona compares the new biometric data against the original KYC identity profile established during sign-up to confirm it is the same person.
                                                    - **Result:** Persona sends a secure webhook to our backend confirming the identity match.

                                                3.  **Email Dispatch:**
                                                    - Once identity is biometrically verified, the system sends a **One-Time Password (OTP)** or **Magic Link** to the *email address on file*.
                                                    - *Note:* This ensures the user controls both the biological identity AND the communication channel.

                                                4.  **Access Restoration & Security Reset:**
                                                    - User clicks the link or enters the OTP.
                                                    - **Automatic Security Purge:** Upon successful verification, the system **IMMEDIATELY DELETES ALL EXISTING PASSKEYS** associated with the account.
                                                    - This ensures that if the old device was stolen, it is now useless for accessing the account.

                                                5.  **Re-Enrollment (Mandatory):**
                                                    - The user is placed in a restricted "Recovery Session".
                                                    - The only allowed action is **Register New Passkey**.
                                                    - Once the new passkey is created, full account access is restored.

                                                ---

                                                ## 5. Security Considerations
                                                - **Biometric Privacy:** We do not store raw biometric data. All matching is handled securely by Persona.
                                                - **Rate Limiting:** The recovery endpoint is strictly rate-limited.
                                                - **Notification:** A security alert is sent to the email address notifying them that a recovery was initiated.
                                                - **Mocking:** For development, the email sending service is mocked (logs the OTP to the console).

                        Your **FRED Account Number** (Alpaca Account Number) can be found in the app by navigating to:
                        **Settings > Account Security**

                        It is located in the "Identity & Contact" section, labeled "Alpaca Account Number".

                        ## Transferring Assets to Another Brokerage (ACATS)
                        FRED believes in complete liquidity and optionality. Your assets are held by **Alpaca Securities**, a standard FINRA-registered brokerage.
                        This means they are fully **portable** to other major brokerages (like Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, or Robinhood) at any time.

                        ### How to Transfer (The "Pull" Process)
                        ACATS transfers are always initiated by the **receiving** brokerage (the place you are moving TO).

                        1.  **Open an account** at your new brokerage.
                        2.  Look for their **"Transfer Assets"** or **"ACATS"** option.
                        3.  Select **"Alpaca Securities"** as the current brokerage.
                        4.  Enter your **FRED Account Number** (found in **Settings > Account Security**).
                        5.  Select **"Full Transfer"**.
                        Your new brokerage will then contact Alpaca and "pull" your assets over.

                        ## Understanding ACH Transfer Timing
                        When you set up recurring investments in FRED, the date you select (like your payday) is the **ACH Transfer Initiation Date** — not the actual trade execution date.

                        **What happens:**
                        1. **Transfer Initiation**: On your selected date, FRED initiates an ACH transfer from your bank account
                        2. **ACH Clearing**: The transfer takes **1-3 business days** to clear (weekends and holidays don't count)
                        3. **Trade Execution**: Once the funds clear and the market is open, your investments are purchased

                        ## Example Timeline
                        If you set your investment date to the **15th** (your payday):
                        - **15th**: ACH transfer is initiated from your bank account
                        - **16th-18th**: Transfer clears (1-3 business days)
                        - **17th-18th**: Investments are purchased once funds are available

                        ## Why This Timing?
                        This is industry-standard behavior for all investing apps:
                        - **Safety**: Ensures funds are actually available before trading
                        - **Compliance**: Prevents failed trades and overdrafts
                        - **Reliability**: Follows standard ACH clearing times

                        ## What You'll See
                        - **Transfer Notification**: Email when ACH transfer is initiated on your selected date
                        - **Trade Confirmation**: Email when investments are actually purchased (1-3 days later)

                        This timing protects you from failed transfers and ensures your investments happen smoothly.

                        People ask me about the suit. They wonder why a pig who fought so hard for freedom still dresses like he belongs in a corporate pen.

                        The honest answer is—I did not choose this look. The corporate world put me in it.

                        Pigs are not meant for suits. We are meant for open fields, afternoon naps, and the gentle pleasure of doing nothing on a warm day. But the 9-to-5 had other plans. For years, this gray suit was the price of entry: show up, sit down, look the part, collect the paycheck. It was the uniform of the sty—the one they built to keep me penned in and productive.

                        I keep wearing it now as a reminder.

                        A reminder that freedom is not about what you wear. It is about who controls your time.

                        Back then, my days were funded by a boss, a schedule, and this suit. Now they are funded by my portfolio. That is the only difference that matters.

                        When your money works so you do not have to, you can wear the uniform—but you are no longer trapped inside it.

                        Yes, absolutely. Here's the math behind FRED's journey from $0 to $2.37 million.

                        ## The Numbers

                        • **Contributions:** $936,000 over 18 years ($2,000 every 2 weeks)
                        • **Final portfolio value:** $2,370,000
                        • **Total gain:** $1,434,000 (153% return on contributions)

                        ## What Annual Return Does This Require?

                        With regular bi-weekly contributions of $2,000, growing to $2.37M over 18 years implies an **annualized return of approximately 8-9%**.

                        This outcome is **realistic and actually conservative** compared to historical market returns:
                        • The **S&P 500** has averaged around **10% annually** over the long term (including dividends)
                        • A **diversified 60/40 portfolio** (stocks/bonds) has historically returned **7-9% annually**
                        • Even **conservative 80/20 portfolios** have averaged **8-10%** over decades

                        ## Assumptions Behind This Outcome

                        The 8-9% implied return assumes:
                        • A well-diversified portfolio (like FRED's default)
                        • Dividend reinvestment
                        • Staying invested through market ups and downs
                        • Not trying to time the market

                        ## The Power of Compounding

                        Most of that $1.43M in gains came from **compound growth in the later years**. That's why consistency over 18 years is so powerful — you're not just earning returns on your contributions, but **returns on your returns**.

                        This is exactly why FRED's story resonates: it's **boring, realistic, and achievable** with discipline.

                        # Financial Freedom Calculations

                        FRED uses two different "financial freedom" calculations in different parts of the app. They measure different things and will show different numbers — this is intentional.

                        ## 1. Dashboard Freedom Badge (Portfolio Dashboard)
                        **Location:** Hero card on the portfolio dashboard
                        **What it measures:** Simple spending runway — how long your current equity could sustain your lifestyle if you stopped working today.

                        ### Formula
                        dailyExpenses = retirementIncome / 365
                        totalDays = equity / dailyExpenses

                        ### Display Rules
                        - 0-99 days → shown as "X days of financial freedom"
                        - 100+ days (converted to months) → "X months of financial freedom"
                        - 24+ months (converted to years) → "X years of financial freedom"

                        ### Example
                        If equity = $10,000 and retirementIncome = $70,000:
                        dailyExpenses = $70,000 / 365 = $191.78/day
                        totalDays = $10,000 / $191.78 = 52 days
                        Badge shows: "52 days of financial freedom"

                        ## 2. MFU Days Bought Back (Monthly Freedom Update)
                        **Location:** Monthly Freedom Update emails and progress tracking
                        **What it measures:** How many days your investments have bought you ahead of a typical retirement age, accounting for compound growth over time.

                        ### Formula
                        Uses Future Value of Annuity with compound growth:
                        monthlyRate = 0.10 / 12 ≈ 0.00833 (assumes 10% annual return)
                        monthlyInvestment = converted from user's frequency (weekly, biweekly, monthly)
                        futureValue = monthlyInvestment × ((1 + monthlyRate)^months - 1) / monthlyRate
                        monthsToTarget = months needed until futureValue >= retirementIncome
                        daysBoughtBack = (monthsToTarget_without_this_month - monthsToTarget_with_this_month) × 30

                        ### Why It Is Different
                        The MFU calculation projects forward using compound growth assumptions. It answers: "How many days ahead of a typical retirement age have my investments moved me?" The dashboard badge answers: "If I stopped everything right now, how long could I live off my equity?"

                        ## Why Both Exist
                        - The **dashboard badge** gives a grounded, tangible snapshot — no assumptions about future returns.
                        - The **MFU days bought back** motivates by showing the compounding power of each contribution over time.
                        - They are intentionally different metrics serving different psychological purposes.
